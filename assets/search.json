        "content": "I must say that I’m really proud of the results I got at the Star Party of Campo Catino! Targets photographed: the Andromeda Galaxy, the Dumbbell Nebula, the Triangulum Galaxy, the Pinwheel Galaxy and the Pacman Nebula! Check them out in the post!\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy\n\n\nThe Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M 31, is our closest galactic neighbour: a huge spiral galaxy, 2.54 million light-years away! It has more or less the same mass of the Milky Way, our home, but is bigger: it has a diameter of approximatively 220,000 light-years! It also has twice the number of stars our galaxy has. Unlike other galaxies, which are walking away from us, according to Hubble’s Law (therefore they’re redshifted), the Andromeda Galaxy is blueshifted: this means that someday, in 4.5 billion years, it will collide with our galaxy. It also has two satellite galaxies, M 32 and M 110, that are also visible in my photo.\n\nM 31 was first thought to be a nebula, starting from the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in 964 A.D. Later, in 1612, the astronomer Simon Marius described it thanks to some observations with his telescope. In 1745, the French mathematician Pierre Louis Maupertuis conjectured that the spot was an “island universe”. After 19 years Charles Messier categorized it in his Messier Catalog with the index number 31 and estimated its distance to 18,000 light-years. Our time machine must wait till 1850 to see the Anglo-Irish William Parsons draw Andromeda’s spiral structure and till 1864 to see the English astronomer Sir William Huggins understand that its spectrum is different from nebulae’s ones: there are no emission lines in it, just absorption lines!\n\nLater in the years, in 1885 and 1917, supernovae were observed in the Andromeda Nebula, but since they looked 10 magnitudes fainter than those that occurred elsewhere in the sky, the American astronomer Heber Curtis was able to estimate the distance to 500,000 light-years: from that moment on, the “island universes” (galaxies) hypothesis started to be considered the best one.\n\nWe still have to wait until 1925 for Edwin Hubble, who discovered the first extragalactic Cepheid variable star in the Andromeda Galaxy: thanks to this kind of variable star, whose period is proportional to their brightness, he was finally able to say that the Andromeda Nebula is, in reality, a Galaxy, far away from any other object in the Milky Way.\n\nMy photo\nI took 20 photos of the Andromeda Galaxy, from 4 AM to 4:20, right before dawn. Each sub is 60 seconds long, at ISO 1600, but thanks to the very low light pollution in Campo Catino they’re very sharp and with an excellent Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). I processed these photos in Astro Pixel Processor and The GIMP, together with dark and flat frames.\n\nThe Dumbbell Nebula\n\n\nThe dumbbell Nebula, also known as M 27 or NGC 6853, is a planetary nebula in the constellation Vulpecula. It is 1227 light-years away from Earth and its estimated age is 9,800 years.\n\nThis kind of nebulae is due to the expanding, glowing shell of ionized gas ejected from the surface of red giant stars during the very last stages of their life. Strong stellar winds are thought to be the cause of the expulsion of the gas. Meanwhile, the nucleus of the star starts emitting ultraviolet radiation, which ionizes the ejected layers and makes them produce visible light. Only stars whose masses from 0.8 solar masses to 8 solar masses are likely to become planetary nebulae since greater stars usually end their lives in dramatic supernovae explosions. Planetary nebulae are frequently spherical, but they can also create more complex structures.\n\nThe nucleus of the star will later collapse and create a white dwarf in the centre of the nebula. M 27’s central star radius is the largest known for a white dwarf! The term “planetary nebula” derives from the planet-like round shape these nebulae have and was coined by the first astronomers who discovered them.\n\nMy photo\nTo make every detail visible, I took various photos at different exposure times: 2x 120s ISO1600, 5x 120s ISO3200, 1x 150s ISO1600, 6x 180s ISO1600. The total exposure time is 35 minutes. Processing in Astro Pixel Processor and The GIMP.\n\nThe Triangulum Galaxy\n\n\nThe Triangulum Galaxy is a spiral galaxy 2.73 million light-years from Earth. It can be found in the constellation Triangulum and is also known as Messier 33. It the third-largest member of the Local Group of galaxies, behind the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. It is one of the most distant objects that can be viewed with the naked eye, even if it can’t be seen in light-polluted areas like mine. Its galactic nucleus is mostly made of H-II nebulae, so it’s full of star-forming regions. The total diameter of the galaxy is about 60,000 light-years, about 60% the one of the Milky Way. Like Andromeda, it’s blueshifted, so it will probably collide with our galaxy someday.\n\nIt was first discovered by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna near 1654, and later rediscovered in 1764 by Charles Messier, who added it to his catalogue.\n\nMy photo\n\nI was able to capture 81 60-seconds-each subs at ISO 3200, for a total of 1.3 hours! The resulting stacked photo, processed with Astro Pixel Processor and The GIMP, looks gorgeous!\n\nThe Pinwheel Galaxy\n\n\nM 101, also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, is a SAB(rs)cd spiral galaxy in the constellation Ursa Major. It is 21 million light-years away from Earth and faces towards us. It’s 170,000 light-years in diameter, so it’s smaller in size than the Milky Way, whose diameter is 258,000 ly. However, it has twice the number of stars of our galaxy! Moreover, a high population of Hydrogen II is present. It was discovered in 1791 by the French astronomer Pierre Méchain, who asked Charles Messier to add it to his Messier catalogue.\n\nMy photo\n\nI took 23 180s-long photos at ISO 1600 for a total of 1.15 hours, plus dark, flat and bias frames. Processing in Astro Pixel Processor and The GIMP.\n\nThe Pacman Nebula\n\n\nNGC 281, also known as the Pacman Nebula for his unusual shape, similar to the video game character, is a 48 light-years wide emission nebula in the circumpolar constellation Cassiopeia. It is associated with the open cluster IC 1590, which also emits light that helps the nebula glow. It’s mostly made of Hydrogen II and Oxigen III (ionized gas), belongs to the Perseus Spiral Arm (an arm of the Milky Way, ours is the Orion–Cygnus Arm) and is 9500 light-years from Earth. It was first discovered by the American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard in 1883.\n\nMy photo\n\nI took 41 photos, 120 seconds each (total 1.3 hours), at ISO 3200, plus dark, bias and flat frames. Stacking and processing in Astro Pixel Processor, Darktable and The GIMP. I got a good result considering the low exposure time and the high ISO.\n",

It’s visible to the naked eye, even from a light polluted area like mine and it’s the closest star cluster to Earth (444 light-years). It’s dominated by hot blue bright stars that have formed within the last 100 million years, while the reflection nebulae around them are made of dust clouds in the interstellar medium (blue nebulae are always reflection one). Galileo Galilei was the first astronomer to view the Pleiades through a telescope and discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim to be seen with the naked eye. He published his observations, including a sketch of the Pleiades showing 36 stars, in his treatise Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.\n\nThe photo\n\n24 frames, 280 seconds ISO 200 per photo, processing in Astro Pixel Processor and GIMP.

        "content": "I’ve got a Nikon D3300, that I didn’t “astro-modify”, so the red channel is weaker than the others. This, unfortunately, leads to incorrect colour balance in bright emission nebulae like M 42: an exposure time that gives you a good result in one channel may not give you a good effect in the others. Sometimes, I process each channel of my images separately, and when I do it I notice the wrong balance:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nFortunately, the UHC filter (Ultra High Contrast light pollution broadband filter) helps, especially in the light polluted area where I live! I have a PrimaLuceLab 2’’ filter and I’m very satisfied: no artefacts in the image, very good contrast and colours. In my experience, a single 60 sec shot to M 42 with the filter gave me a better result as compared to an entire sequence without it (see the previous post to take a look to the photo)!\nRemember that, since it’s a nebular filter, you can only use it only with emission nebulae, whose spectrum shows only H-alpha, H-beta and O-III peaks, that pass through the filter. Reflection nebulae and galaxies have a different spectrum that may be partially blocked by this kind of filters!\nEnjoy your filter!\n",

It shows a spiral shape with no central bar, and moderate arms, and is classified as a “SAbc” galaxy in Edwin Hubble’s morphological classification; in other words, it is classified between “normal” spiral galaxies and galaxies with barred spirals.

It is 2570 light-years away from Earth. This kind of nebula takes origin from a shell of ionized gas expelled into the surrounding interstellar medium by a star at the end of its asymptotic giant branch phase, in the last stages of its life before becoming a white dwarf (which is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of dense degenerated matter).\nM 57 was first discovered in January 1779 by the French astronomer Charles Messier when he was looking for Comet Bode. Later, the astronomer William Herschel speculated that the nebula was formed by several stars that were unresolvable with his telescope. In 1800, Friedrich von Hahn announced that he discovered the central white dwarf, but only in 1864, the English astronomer William Huggins examined the spectrum of this object, realizing that it’s a nebulosity, so it is not composed of multiple faint stars as Herschel proposed before.\n\nMy photo\nI was able to capture only 8 photos of 380 seconds at ISO 800 before dawn. I also used a UHC filter and I captured several dark and frames. Then, I processed them using Astro Pixel Processor only. The final photo is quite good if you consider that the sky in my backyard is almost light blue even at midnight due to light pollution. Even the colours are balanced.\n\nThe Whale Galaxy and the Hockey Stick Galaxy\n\nThe Whale Galaxy\n\nNGC 4631 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici. This galaxy’s slightly distorted wedge shape gives it the appearance of a whale, that’s why it has that nickname. It is 30 megalight-year far away from us. The Whale Galaxy contains a central starburst, which is a region of intense star formation, that is evident in the emission of ionized hydrogen. Moreover, due to the huge number of supernovae which exploded in this galaxy, diffuse X-ray emitting gas around the whole galaxy can be observed by space telescopes.\n\nThe Hockey Stick Galaxy\n\nNGC 4656 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Canes Venatici. It is informally called the Hockey Stick Galaxies. The reason for this is that it is actually shaped like an elongated, warped stick. The unusual shape is thought to be due to an interaction between NGC 4656 and a couple of near neighbours, the Whale Galaxy and NGC 4627 (a small elliptical galaxy). Like NGC 4631, it is 30 megalight-year far away from us.\n\nMy photo\n\nI captured 28 photos for a total of 2 hours and 51 minutes (380 seconds subs at ISO 800).

You’ll be able to build, name, launch and control a sounding rocket at the Andøya Space Center, 2° North from the Polar Circle!\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nMy experience\n\nI had the incredible opportunity to attend the “European Space Camp 2019” at the Andøya Space Center, from the 8th of August to the 15th, together with other young boys and girls from all over the world. I really could not believe my eyes when I saw an email by the head of the camp, Gaute, telling me that I was accepted, that I had to buy tickets for the plane, fly to Oslo and the Andenes, 3000 Km away from home. I started dreaming of going to this camp since I was 16, so you can imagine how happy I was at that moment!\n\nDuring all the camp I worked together with my team, the Payload team, together with Helena from Norway and Charles from New Zealand, to build the payload of the rocket we launched at the end of the camp. We had to decide where to put each sensor (made by the Sensors group) on the plate, wire everything, test the rocket with the Telemetry group and then take it to the launch area. Moreover, I was the “Payload Manager”: every decision had to be approved by me, I had to write down all the formulae for the sensors and tell the Telemetry Team about them, and finally press the “ARM!” button right before the launch of the rocket “Space Shipriani IV”, which was named after me by the rest of the Payload Team since I did a pretty good job organizing everything: just two student rockets were completed by students only since the Space Camp was established in 1996, the other ones had to be completed by the NAROM teachers before the launch! We were proud of our result!\n\nI had unforgettable moments with everyone, from the various social activities organized by Anders to the morning astronaut-themed gym, from understanding the formulae needed to get the data from the sensors to analyzing that data. The Space Camp was a wonderful opportunity to share ideas with people from all over the world (10 different nations, from Poland to Russia, from Finland to New Zealand and the USA!), learn a lot of new things about how to work in Space Centers, Aurora Borealis, satellites, travels to Mars and so on. All this speaking English all the time! People there are awesome, not only the Team Space Camp and the participants, but also all the NAROM (National Center for Space-related Education) employees, who helped us understand how to assemble the rocket and analyse the data.\n\nHowever, Space Camp is not only making rockets or playing together. The rest of the time we attended lectures about the work of the Space Center and Kongsberg, how Northern Lights glow, the activity of the Sun and the all the rovers that arrived on the Red Planet. I’m thankful to all the experts who talked during these lessons, especially \nSophie Cottis-Allan, who arrived directly from the British National Space Academy to show us lunar rocks, solar panels from Hubble Space Telescope and IR cameras. Moreover, Team Space Camp asked me to hold a lecture about astrophotography! You can find the presentation at the bottom of the page!\n\nWe also met the Russian cosmonaut Andrej Borisenko, who showed us exclusive videos recorded inside the Soyuz spacecraft and answered all of our questions about how life is in the ISS.  He gave gifts to who asked the best questions, plus one lapel pin to me because I fixed his broken Jurij Gagarin pin! Later, he signed our books and participated in the launch of the rocket! I also gave him a photo of mine, the Pleiades, to thank him and he was really happy to receive it!\n\nAfter the launch, which was completed successfully, we analyzed all the data the telemetry stations received and realized that our rocket arrived up to 8.5 Km at a vertical speed of more than 800 m/s! We had a lot of sensors inside the rocket: temperature, pressure, current, battery voltage, light, magnetic field, acceleration and GPS. Feel free to download the Payload Team’s presentation at the bottom of the page, it’s full of data and there’s the full list of sensors with photos! We also named every sensor, take a look at the names!\n\nThe evening after the launch we had a bonfire altogether, so we ate marshmallows and bread while talking and walking on the beach, near the arctic sea in which we swam the previous hour! Instead, the last evening we had a show in which every team organized games or dances: quizzes by the Sensors Team, swing by our team and a song by the Team Space Camp! It was a magic moment!\n\nI would like to end this post with a loud THANK YOU to everyone who took part in the European Space Camp!\nHelena, Charles, Florian, Moriz, Marcus, Astrid, Sophie, Anna, Magnus, Mathias, Vilde, Azat, Emil, Hans, Anne, Kasia, Hope, Stefan, Ethan, Finn, Natalie, Lucia, Ellen, Gaute, Tiia, Anders, Nina, Inge and all the NAROM teachers!\nI’ll never forget you!\n\nDownloads\n\ncloud_download Astrophotography lecture by Marco Cipriani\n\ncloud_download Payload Team presentation\n",

    "excerpt": "Caprile Observatory\n",
    "content": "After my final high school exam, a friend of mine asked me if I was available for what turned out to be my greatest project: building an astronomical observatory in the Florence’s countryside.\nAmbitious, hard, but here I am telling you about it! First of all, I am sorry if I will not provide exact instructions on how to build it: as you can imagine,\nthere are so many parts in this observatory that it would take me a year just to describe everything. However, if you want to make your own,\nI invite you to thinker and come up with your unique solutions to the problems you will certainly face: by doing so, you will certainly learn a lot and enjoy more the journey!\n\nSponsor\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nThanks to DigitSpace for sponsoring this project! They contributed to the making of the electronics by providing sensors,\ncameras and other components! More about them in the section about the electronics.\n\nPhotos\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThe aim of the project\n\nMy friend wanted a fully remote observatory for his astrophotography setup, possibly on a budget and as reliable as possible.\nUnfortunately, pre-made sliding structures are really expensive, usually made of metal (so hard to dismantle and recycle) and lack the kind of remote control he wanted.\nThere are also remote control systems, but they are usually professional and complex. That said, the aim of this project was to find a custom solution to all these problems\nwhile being a great opportunity of learning and making experience.\n\nThe plan\n\nEvery big project must have one: in this case, there were a lot a constrains and requirements that needed to be fulfilled:\n\n\n  The roof must slide completely and the structure must not hide parts of the sky\n  No cement foundations, since the observatory would be located in a front yard and not in building plot\n  Must withstand the snow and heavy rain typical of that place\n  Must not require special machines to build or extraordinary transports for the material\n  Stay within a budget of €3000, labor and astronomical equipment excluded\n  Must be fully remote, have a web interface to open/close the roof and monitor everything\n  Must be able to turn on and off the equipment, the telescope’s PC and the AC plugs\n  Security cameras and PIR alarm, with notifications and recording\n  Weather station, all-sky camera and anemometer\n\n\nMoreover, add to this list the countless dimension limits and the sleepless nights spent defining every single detail before start the actual design!\nBear in mind that this is a simplified list of the fundamental requirements: the accurate planning of the observatory took an entire month of full-time work for both me and my friend.\nWe had to research and study a lot about how to build wood structure, think about the sliding roof, look for the best suited electronic components and so on.\n\nDesigning the structure\n\nThis was no easy task: I had to draw every single part of the observatory using Fusion 360 for a number of reasons:\nI needed to check each dimension, get a sense of how the structure would be, simulate the movements of the telescope (i.e. use motion studies to point the telescope and see if the walls block the view)\nand finally create a sort of instruction manual for my friend to buy, cut and assemble the wood. Indeed, due the 2020 pandemic and the fact that I live in Rome, away from the place where it would have\nbeen built, my friend built the structure on his own following my design, while I worked on the electronics at home.\n\nI will not be providing the exact instructions and dimensions, since they are labelled in Italian and would be above all pointless without an exact explanation of each part.\nHere are, however, some of renderings I’ve done:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nPower and ethernet\n\nBringing power and ethernet from the house to the place was no easy task: 100m of thick 4mm² power cable were necessary, plus a shielded CAT6 ethernet cable.\nThe wires had to go though a wall, under a pathway, above some threes up to the field. Since it was an old countryside house, we even had to upgrade the\nelectrical cabinet and ask an ISP for wireless internet (with a receiver dish on top of the house)! If it weren’t enough, the ethernet cable turned out to be\nunable to transfer data over such a distance, so we had to add a PoE (power-over-ethernet) rang extender in the middle of the cable.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nOther important factors that needed consideration were the grounding of the new electrical system and the ethernet surge protection,\njust in case a lightning or other disruptive event occurs.\n\nThe structure\n\nThe observatory’s structure is composed of several fir wood panels and beams, except for the six main vertical carrier beams, which are made of local chestnut wood. \nThis is very important because those are the only parts of the structure in direct contact with the ground and chestnut wood is resistant to rain and rotting.\nPanels and beams were sourced from local sawmills and carpentries and then refined by my friend.\n\nAlmost 20kg of high protective impregnating agent were used to paint all the parts, and a layer of melted tar was applied on the tips of the carrier\nbeams to further protect them when they are buried into the ground.\n\nThe first construction phase included the ground leveling and the installation of the base for the telescope column (a prefabricated 50x50cm concrete cockpit was used for this purpose).\nAll the works were done manually with hoe and shovel and the aid of a demolition hammer for the concrete cockpit trench and main vertical carrier beams pits.\nBelow the first layer of grass and dirt, the ground was composed of relatively compact marl and siltstone, which is good for the overall stability of the structure.\nSome cement was also poured around the concrete cockpit to further improve the stiffness and stability of the telescope base.\n\nThe six main chestnut wood carrier beams were fixed into the ground, while the rest of the structure leans over concrete outdoor\nfloor tiles placed on a leveled gravel bed (also helping with water drainage).\n\nThe rest of the carpentry works involved fixing the whole structure together, including the long 5m horizontal beams that serve as a base for the rails of the roll-off roof.\nBituminous membrane was applied to further protect the base of the structure and the front canopy.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThe roof\n\nThe roof was assembled directly in-place due to its size and weight. It slides on the rails thanks to four v-groove gate wheels.\nThen, two insulating metal panels were bolted on top of the wooden structure. Such panels were chosen for their relative lightness, high stiffness and good thermal insulation properties.\n\nAll the works were done late in the day and even at night to escape the intense heat of the summer season! Finally, the telescope column was bolted to the concrete cockpit base.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nServer and electronics\n\nThe server of observatory is in charge of serving a web interface for remote management. It runs on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 3,\nequivalent to a Pi 3B+ but with two camera inputs (one for the security camera and one for the all-sky). The board is then connected to\nan Arduino Nano and a custom-made PCB which allow the server to control relays, check the sensors and move the roof’s stepper motor.\nInside the electronics there is also a Gigabit network switch with surge protector, a Wi-Fi AP, the server power supply and all the power management\nsystem (consisting of several relays, MOSFETs and derivations for both the 12V and 220V lines).\nSurrounding the main box, an IR camera, switchable IR LEDs (to avoid disturbing the telescope’s CCD) and a PIR sensor were added.\n\nHuge thanks to DigitSpace for providing most of the electronics used in this project: they were so kind to send me Arduino sensors,\nspare electronics parts and a Raspberry Pi camera to complete the server box.

Photos of the completed server:\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nWeather station\n\nThe observatory’s weather station has several sensors which can report rain, external temperature, light and wind speed.\nPlus, there is an all-sky fisheye camera used to check for cloud coverage. The box of weather station was made starting from an IP65\nelectronic enclosure and a plexiglass dome, sealed with silicon. Then, I used cable glands and corrugated pipes to route the wires from the station\nto the server, where everything is connected. A Raspberry Pi High-Quality camera with a 2.5mm fisheye lens was used for the all-sky camera, held in place\nby some 3D printed parts and later covered by a piece of foam sheet; the light sensor was mounted near the camera inside the dome and it was used to switch between\nnight and day modes for the cameras. Adhesive 12V heaters were added around the dome (internally) and beneath the rain sensor\nto get rid of the dew. The anemometer was mounted on a grounded iron rod and then connected to the weather station.\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nThe motor and the sliding system\n\nThe roll-off roof slides thanks to two house gate rails and four v-groove gate wheels. It is moved by a huge NEMA 34 closed-loop stepper motor capable of\nproviding up to 9Nm of torque. This enormous amount of force helps the roof overcome friction, the small misalignment of both the rails and the rack and wind,\nas the observatory must be able to close even in emergency situations. One month after the completion of the observatory, indeed, while the roof was open and the telescope\nwas in use, a sudden 50Kph wind started blowing, and the motor was capable of closing everything in less than two minutes. The motor’s encoder ensures that the stepper\nnever loses steps, which may lead to a partially open or closed observatory.\n\nThe motor was mounted on the roof, which means that it moves while the rack stands still. While it is an unusual configuration, it was the only solution to the constrains\nof the observatory. As an advantage, however, this system allowed us to put the motor and the pinion below the rack, which means that strong wind cannot lift the roof\n(at least without breaking the motor or its support). The other side of the roof is locked by electromagnetic locks, which block both manual sliding and roof lifting when engaged.\n\nTwo endstops, one at the beginning and one at the end of the track, help the software double-check if the roof is closed and eventually correct with extra steps.\nThanks to these stops, the software can also automatically park the roof when it doesn’t know the current position or operate the roof after a power loss.\nMoreover, the motor is powered by a 48V 8A power supply and a closed-loop stepper driver, connected to the Arduino which sends the signals.\nOverall, the roof takes up to two minutes to close or open.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nA very difficult part was getting the right stepper driver and power supply for the job. After two months of runtime, the 8A power supply broke down\nand needed to be replaced by a good, heavy toroidal transformer (some stepper drivers accept both DC and AC inputs).\nUnfortunately, the first stepper driver had bad luck and burnt too, probably because of excessive peak load or because of the switching power supply.\nIt was replaced by a more expensive StepperOnline driver with a higher current rating.\nBecause of all these dead electronics parts, we decided to replace the UPS of the observatory with a bigger pure sine-wave UPS, more suited for\npeak loads, toroidal transformers and sensitive devices. Note: these new parts are not shown in the photos.\n\nWeb interface\n\nThe web interface can be viewed from any browser, which makes it extremely convenient and easy to use. It provides the following functionalities:\n\n  Shows the cameras in real time\n  Displays the history of every sensor in the past four hours\n  Can turn on and off every device and power plug\n  Opens and closes the roof, shows the curren position and the status of the endstops\n  Sends wake signals to the telescope’s computer\n  Records using the security camera if a movement is detected via the PIR sensor\n  Controls the weather station’s heaters\n  Logs and displays all the errors that occur\n\n\nHere are some screenshots (the UI is in Italian, sorry):\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThe results!\n\nThese are some of the astro-photos taken from the Caprile Observatory, remotely controlled from Florence:\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nMore photos of the observatory on Nik Coli’s AstroBin!\n\n\n\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.\n\n",

    "content": "\n  \n\n\n  JustAPendulum is an Arduino-based open-source pendulum that measures and calculates the oscillation period to find the gravitational acceleration of the Earth (~9,81 m/s²). It contains a homemade Arduino UNO that uses an USB-to-serial adapter to communicate with your computer. JustAPendulum is highly accurate and has a companion (written in Visual Basic .NET) that, in real-time, will show you the position of the mass and a table and a graph with all the precedent measures. Completely laser cut and homemade, it’s very easy-to-use: just push a button and let the mass fall and the board will calculate everything. Ideal for tests in physics classes!\n\nThe physics behind it\n\nThese are all the formulae used in JustAPendulum. I’m not going to demonstrate them, but if you’re curious, this information is easy to find in every physics book. To calculate the gravitational acceleration of the Earth, the pendulum simply measures the oscillation period \\(T\\), then uses the following formula to calculate \\(g\\):\n\n[g=4\\pi^2{l \\over T^2}]\n\nand this one to calculate the absolute error over the acceleration:\n\n[e_g=g\\biggl({0.01 m \\over l}+2{0.001 s \\over T}\\biggr)]\n\n$l$ is the length of the wire of the pendulum. This parameter must be set from the Companion program (see below). $0.01 m$ is the measurement error of the length (sensibility of the ruler is assumed 1 cm), while $0.001 s$ is the precision of Arduino’s clock.\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    A scheme of a pendulum\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    A scheme of a pendulum\n\n\nGalileo Galilei and this formula\n\nThis formula was first (partially) discovered by Galileo Galilei around 1602, who investigated on the regular motion of pendulums, making pendulums be adopted as the most precise timekeeping machines until 1930 when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. According to one of Galileo’s students, Galileo was attending a Mass in Pisa when he noticed that wind caused very slight motion of a chandelier suspended in the cathedral. He kept looking at the motion of the chandelier and he noticed that even though the breeze stopped and the back-and-forth distance travelled by the pendulum shortened, yet the time it took the chandelier to make the oscillation seemed to remain constant. He timed the swinging of the chandelier by the regular beating of the pulse in his wrist and realized he was right: no matter the distance travelled, the time it took was always the same. After more measurements and studies, he then found out that\n\n[T \\alpha \\sqrt{ L \\over g }]\n\nThe two times $\\pi$, as in the in the previous equation, turns the proportional expression into a true equation - but that involves a mathematical stratagem that Galileo hadn’t got.\n\nUsage\n\n\n  \n\n\nPlease note that before using the digital pendulum sensors must be calibrated and wire length adjusted. Put JustAPendulum below a pendulum (minimum 1m tall recommended) and make sure that the mass obscures all the three sensors when oscillating. Sensors work better in low light conditions, so turn off the lights. Switch on the board. A “Ready” screen will appear. Here’s the menu structure:\n\n  Left button: to start the measurements, put the ball to the right and press the button. Arduino automatically detects the ball position and starts.\n    \n      “Starting… o.p.: x ms” is displayed\n        \n          Left: calculate gravitational acceleration\n          Right: back to the main screen\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Right button: show configuration\n    \n      Right: yes\n      Left: no\n    \n  \n\n\nThe companion\n\nJustAPendulum’s companion is a Visual Basic .NET (written in Visual Studio 2015) program that allows the user to monitor the pendulum in real-time from the computer. It displays the last values and errors, has tables and graphs to show the past measures and has tools to calibrate the sensors and to set the length of the wire. History can also be exported to Excel.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nCalibrating the sensors\n\nGo the Advanced tab, turn on “ADC monitor” and observe how the displayed values change depending on the position of the ball. Try to find out an acceptable threshold: below it will mean no mass between the detectors, while above it will indicate that the mass is passing between them. If the values don’t change, maybe there’s too much light in the room, so turn off the lamps. Then, press the “Manual calibration” button. Write in the text box the threshold you decided and press enter.\n\nChanging the wire length\n\nTo adjust the length of the wire press the “Wire length” button and enter the value. Then set the measurement error: if you measured it with a tape measure the sensitiveness should be 1 mm.\nAll the values will be stored in the memory of the ATmega328P microcontroller.\n\nGallery\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nBuilding it!\n\nMaking JustAPendulum yourself is very easy and requires only some low-cost stuff.

    "content": "\n  \n\n\n RoverBluetooth is the name I gave to the Arduino-based Bluetooth car I made for my school exam when I was only thirteen. I also showed it at Maker Faire Rome with a FabLab (and I was one of the youngest there)! It’s very easy to make (only a few low-cost electronic components and a Meccano pack) and to control, thanks to the Android app I programmed. It features full speed control, reverse gear, an ultrasonic sensor with parking sound and emergency brake, low-latency remote drive and a frontal light.\n\nThe app\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nI originally programmed the app with MIT App Inventor, but then I decided to write it from scratch using Android Studio. If you’re an Android beginner, I would recommend you using the original app (released in the App Inventor gallery), since it’s easier to program and to edit. Otherwise, the newer app can be found on GitHub.\n\nThe chassis\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nIf you want to replicate mine, buy some Meccano packs, take a look at the pictures and start screwing! Pay attention to the steering wheel, that must have a connection to the servo motor, rotate without friction and without unscrewing! The main body shouldn’t flex too much and should be lightweight, while the Meccano motor must have enough reduction gears to be strong.\n\nThe circuit\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nParts needed:\n\n  Bluetooth receiver (I used the BlueSMiRF Silver modem from Sparkfun, but you can also try the classic HC-06, that is cheaper)\n  An Arduino UNO or similar\n  H-bridge (I used a L6203)\n  Ultrasonic sensor\n  Servo motor (strong, with metal gears if possible)\n  Buzzer\n  LED for frontal light\n  9V battery pack\n  Double-sided matrix board\n\n\nNote that the servo motor I used needs 6V, so I added an LM317 to the circuit. Feel free to remove it if your servo requires 5V. Be patient, pick a solderer and make your own Arduino shield!\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nThe Arduino sketch\n\nThe small sketch receives the data, turns on and off the motor and checks the distance from a wall. RoverBluetooth receives data from the Bluetooth modem and associates numbers to commands. For example, “21” is interpreted as “turn off the motor”. Here’s the list:\n\n  0-20 → servo motor position\n  21 → motor off\n  22 → light on\n  23 → light off\n  1000-1255 → motor on, speed\n  1500-1755 → motor on, reverse gear, speed\n\n\nDownloads\n\ncloud_download Autodesk Eagle 9.3.0 schematic\n\ncloud_download MIT App Inventor project and APK\n\ncloud_download Arduino sketch\n\ncloud_download Autodesk Eagle 9.3.0 schematic\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n",

    "content": "Go back\n\nThe laser cut box\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nCut this structure from plywood (4 mm thick) with a laser cut machine, then asseble it, put the components on the panels and fix them with some nails and vinilic glue. Download DXF/DWG files at the bottom of this page (designed with AutoCAD 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThe structure\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nIf you haven’t got a pendulum, you can make one yourself starting from this example (it’s an exact copy of the one I made). A 27,5·16·1 cm piece of plywood, a 5·27,5·2 cm splint and a rod are enough. Then use rings, fishing wire and a ball to complete the pendulum.\n\nThe mass\n\nI hadn’t got an iron mass (would be better, of course), so I made a ball with a 3D printer and I added a ring to hang it to the wire. The heavier and thinner it is (see pendulum clocks: the mass is flat to avoid friction with air), the longer it will oscillate.\n\nThe PCB\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nThis is the less expensive method to create a homemade PCB using only low-cost stuff:\n\n  Laser printer (600 dpi or better)\n  Photo paper\n  Blank circuit board\n  Muriatic acid (&gt;10% HCl)\n  Hydrogen peroxide (10% solution)\n  Clothes iron\n  Acetone\n  Steel wool\n  Safety goggles and gloves\n  Sodium bicarbonate\n  Vinegar\n  Paper towel\n\n\nThe first step is cleaning the blank PCB with steel wool and water. If the copper appears a bit oxidized, you should wash it with vinegar before. Then, scrub the copper side with a paper towel soaked in acetone to remove any remaining dirt. Accurately rub every part of the board. Do not touch the copper with hands!\n\nPrint the PCB.pdf file at the bottom of this page using a laser printer and do not touch it with fingers. Cut it, align the image on the copper side and press it with the clothes iron (it must be hot but without vapour) for about five minutes. Let it cool with all the paper, then remove the paper very slowly and carefully under water. If there’s no toner on the copper, repeat the procedure; Use a small permanent marker to fix some missing connections.\n\nNow it’s time to use acid to etch the PCB. In a plastic box put three glasses of muriatic acid and one of hydrogen peroxide; you can also try with equal amounts for a more powerful etching. Put the PCB in the solution (pay attention to your hands and eyes) and wait about ten minutes. When the etching is finished remove the board from the solution and wash under water. Put two spoons of sodium bicarbonate in the acid to neutralize the solution and throw it in the WC (or take it to a waste collection centre).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nElectronics\n\nHere’s the schematic:\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nParts needed:\n\n  ATMEGA328P MCU\n  2x 22 pF capacitors\n  3x 100 uF capacitors\n  2x 1N4148 diodes\n  7805TV voltage regulator\n  6x 10K resistors\n  2x 220R resistors\n  16 MHz crystal oscillator\n  Pinheads\n  USB-to-serial adapter\n  940nm side-looking infrared emitters and IR detectors (I bought these from Sparkfun)\n  9V battery and battery holder\n  16x2 LCD screen\n  2 buttons\n  A potentiometer and a trimmer\n  Wires, wires and wires\n\n\nNow that you’ve bought and collected the components, pick a solderer and solder them all! Then fix the PCB in the box, connect all the wires to the LCD, the USB-to-serial adapter, the potentiometer and the trimmer (for display brightness and contrast). Refer to the schematic, the PCB model in the previous step and to Eagle CAD files at the bottom of this page to correctly place all the parts and wires.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nSensors\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nAdd the sensors as shown in the pictures, then make some caps (I used a rotary tool to engrave them from a wood splint) to cover and protect them.
