It’s visible to the naked eye, even from a light polluted area like mine and it’s the closest star cluster to Earth (444 light-years). It’s dominated by hot blue bright stars that have formed within the last 100 million years, while the reflection nebulae around them are made of dust clouds in the interstellar medium (blue nebulae are always reflection one). Galileo Galilei was the first astronomer to view the Pleiades through a telescope and discovered that the cluster contains many stars too dim to be seen with the naked eye. He published his observations, including a sketch of the Pleiades showing 36 stars, in his treatise Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610.\n\nThe photo\n\n24 frames, 280 seconds ISO 200 per photo, processing in Astro Pixel Processor and GIMP.

It’s also associated with an open cluster, NGC 2244, discovered around 1690 by the English astronomer John Flamsteed (1643-1719), while the whole nebula was discovered after some time by Sir John Herschel (1792-1871), another famous English astronomer. It’s 5000 light-years away from the Earth and is 130 ly wide in diameter: so wide that it doesn’t fit the sensor of my DSLR! What about apparent magnitude? 9.0, quite enough to be photographed from an extremely light-polluted area like mine, but not enough for visual astronomy.\n\nMy photo is a two-panel mosaic taken my usual Nikon D3300 and my faithful Newtonian f/5 on my SW EQ 5. I was able to capture only 27 light frames (360 seconds, ISO 1600, UHC filter), but the result is very satisfying! Dark, bias and flat frames. The processed photo has a good SNR (signal-to-noise ration). I stacked the light frames with Astro Pixel Processor, and then I edited them using Darktable, an excellent free alternative to Adobe Lightroom. In particular, this program has a tool called “equalizer”, that helped me enhance the contrasts and reducing noise without compromising quality (I wasn’t successful in GIMP, whose noise-reduction tool blurs the image).\n\nNGC 2403\nNGC 2403 is an intermediate spiral galaxy in the constellation Camelopardalis, near the Lynx one. It’s a member of the M 81 group, it’s 8 million light-years away and has an apparent magnitude of 8.9, similar to the Rosette Nebula. It’s known for the two bright supernovae that were been discovered in it, SN 1954J and SN 2004dj, and was discovered by William Herschel in 1788. Its core is rich of H II regions, the same hydrogen of which the Rosette Nebula is made, so I was able to use the UHC filter for this galaxy, too.

It was discovered by the French astronomer Pierre Méchainin in 1779! It is 29.3 million light-years away from us, so it’s extremely faint (apparent magnitude 9.3)! It shows a spiral shape with no central bar, and moderate arms, and is classified as a “SAbc” galaxy in Edwin Hubble’s morphological classification; in other words, it is classified between “normal” spiral galaxies and galaxies with barred spirals. Indeed, it is also defined as a “flocculent” (soft) galaxy, meaning it has discontinuous spiral arms. It has an estimated mass of  80~140 billion solar masses, and its diameter is about 90000 l-y, thus it is almost the size of the Milky Way. Incredible!\n\nMy photo\nI used for the first time PHD2’s drift align, so I was able to point my telescope perfectly: thanks to this, I was able to capture 29 five minutes subs without having to delete any photo! Despite this fact, since the Moon was 95% illuminated and the light pollution was horrible, each RAW capture is more than ugly. Thanks to 23 darks, 170 offset frames and 100 flats (I exaggerated a bit, I think) I was able to fix this issues during the stacking process in Astro Pixel Processor and The GIMP, so the result is decent.

It is 2570 light-years away from Earth. This kind of nebula takes origin from a shell of ionized gas expelled into the surrounding interstellar medium by a star at the end of its asymptotic giant branch phase, in the last stages of its life before becoming a white dwarf (which is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of dense degenerated matter).\nM 57 was first discovered in January 1779 by the French astronomer Charles Messier when he was looking for Comet Bode. Later, the astronomer William Herschel speculated that the nebula was formed by several stars that were unresolvable with his telescope. In 1800, Friedrich von Hahn announced that he discovered the central white dwarf, but only in 1864, the English astronomer William Huggins examined the spectrum of this object, realizing that it’s a nebulosity, so it is not composed of multiple faint stars as Herschel proposed before.\n\nMy photo\nI was able to capture only 8 photos of 380 seconds at ISO 800 before dawn. I also used a UHC filter and I captured several dark and frames. Then, I processed them using Astro Pixel Processor only. The final photo is quite good if you consider that the sky in my backyard is almost light blue even at midnight due to light pollution. Even the colours are balanced.\n\nThe Whale Galaxy and the Hockey Stick Galaxy\n\nThe Whale Galaxy\n\nNGC 4631 is a barred spiral galaxy in the constellation Canes Venatici. This galaxy’s slightly distorted wedge shape gives it the appearance of a whale, that’s why it has that nickname. It is 30 megalight-year far away from us. The Whale Galaxy contains a central starburst, which is a region of intense star formation, that is evident in the emission of ionized hydrogen. Moreover, due to the huge number of supernovae which exploded in this galaxy, diffuse X-ray emitting gas around the whole galaxy can be observed by space telescopes.\n\nThe Hockey Stick Galaxy\n\nNGC 4656 is a barred spiral galaxy located in the constellation Canes Venatici. It is informally called the Hockey Stick Galaxies. The reason for this is that it is actually shaped like an elongated, warped stick. The unusual shape is thought to be due to an interaction between NGC 4656 and a couple of near neighbours, the Whale Galaxy and NGC 4627 (a small elliptical galaxy). Like NGC 4631, it is 30 megalight-year far away from us.\n\nMy photo\n\nI captured 28 photos for a total of 2 hours and 51 minutes (380 seconds subs at ISO 800). Despite so much time, I wasn’t able to get an excellent result, due to the fact that the two galaxies are so faint (and due to light pollution, too).\n",

    "content": "\n  \n\n\n  JustAPendulum is an Arduino-based open-source pendulum that measures and calculates the oscillation period to find the gravitational acceleration of the Earth (~9,81 m/s²). It contains a homemade Arduino UNO that uses an USB-to-serial adapter to communicate with your computer. JustAPendulum is highly accurate and has a companion (written in Visual Basic .NET) that, in real-time, will show you the position of the mass and a table and a graph with all the precedent measures. Completely laser cut and homemade, it’s very easy-to-use: just push a button and let the mass fall and the board will calculate everything. Ideal for tests in physics classes!\n\nThe physics behind it\n\nThese are all the formulae used in JustAPendulum. I’m not going to demonstrate them, but if you’re curious, this information is easy to find in every physics book. To calculate the gravitational acceleration of the Earth, the pendulum simply measures the oscillation period , then uses the following formula to calculate :\n\n\n\nand this one to calculate the absolute error over the acceleration:\n\n\n\n$l$ is the length of the wire of the pendulum. This parameter must be set from the Companion program (see below). $0.01 m$ is the measurement error of the length (sensibility of the ruler is assumed 1 cm), while $0.001 s$ is the precision of Arduino’s clock.\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    A scheme of a pendulum\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    A scheme of a pendulum\n\n\nGalileo Galilei and this formula\n\nThis formula was first (partially) discovered by Galileo Galilei around 1602, who investigated on the regular motion of pendulums, making pendulums be adopted as the most precise timekeeping machines until 1930 when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War 2. According to one of Galileo’s students, Galileo was attending a Mass in Pisa when he noticed that wind caused very slight motion of a chandelier suspended in the cathedral. He kept looking at the motion of the chandelier and he noticed that even though the breeze stopped and the back-and-forth distance travelled by the pendulum shortened, yet the time it took the chandelier to make the oscillation seemed to remain constant. He timed the swinging of the chandelier by the regular beating of the pulse in his wrist and realized he was right: no matter the distance travelled, the time it took was always the same. After more measurements and studies, he then found out that\n\n\n\nThe two times $\\pi$, as in the in the previous equation, turns the proportional expression into a true equation - but that involves a mathematical stratagem that Galileo hadn’t got.\n\nUsage\n\n\n  \n\n\nPlease note that before using the digital pendulum sensors must be calibrated and wire length adjusted. Put JustAPendulum below a pendulum (minimum 1m tall recommended) and make sure that the mass obscures all the three sensors when oscillating. Sensors work better in low light conditions, so turn off the lights. Switch on the board. A “Ready” screen will appear. Here’s the menu structure:\n\n  Left button: to start the measurements, put the ball to the right and press the button. Arduino automatically detects the ball position and starts.\n    \n      “Starting… o.p.: x ms” is displayed\n        \n          Left: calculate gravitational acceleration\n          Right: back to the main screen\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Right button: show configuration\n    \n      Right: yes\n      Left: no\n    \n  \n\n\nThe companion\n\nJustAPendulum’s companion is a Visual Basic .NET (written in Visual Studio 2015) program that allows the user to monitor the pendulum in real-time from the computer. It displays the last values and errors, has tables and graphs to show the past measures and has tools to calibrate the sensors and to set the length of the wire. History can also be exported to Excel.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nCalibrating the sensors\n\nGo the Advanced tab, turn on “ADC monitor” and observe how the displayed values change depending on the position of the ball. Try to find out an acceptable threshold: below it will mean no mass between the detectors, while above it will indicate that the mass is passing between them. If the values don’t change, maybe there’s too much light in the room, so turn off the lamps. Then, press the “Manual calibration” button. Write in the text box the threshold you decided and press enter.\n\nChanging the wire length\n\nTo adjust the length of the wire press the “Wire length” button and enter the value. Then set the measurement error: if you measured it with a tape measure the sensitiveness should be 1 mm.\nAll the values will be stored in the memory of the ATmega328P microcontroller.\n\nGallery\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nBuilding it!\n\nMaking JustAPendulum yourself is very easy and requires only some low-cost stuff.

    "content": "\n  \n\n\n RoverBluetooth is the name I gave to the Arduino-based Bluetooth car I made for my school exam when I was only thirteen. I also showed it at Maker Faire Rome with a FabLab (and I was one of the youngest there)! It’s very easy to make (only a few low-cost electronic components and a Meccano pack) and to control, thanks to the Android app I programmed. It features full speed control, reverse gear, an ultrasonic sensor with parking sound and emergency brake, low-latency remote drive and a frontal light.\n\nThe app\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nI originally programmed the app with MIT App Inventor, but then I decided to write it from scratch using Android Studio. If you’re an Android beginner, I would recommend you using the original app (released in the App Inventor gallery), since it’s easier to program and to edit. Otherwise, the newer app can be found on GitHub.\n\nThe chassis\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nIf you want to replicate mine, buy some Meccano packs, take a look at the pictures and start screwing! Pay attention to the steering wheel, that must have a connection to the servo motor, rotate without friction and without unscrewing! The main body shouldn’t flex too much and should be lightweight, while the Meccano motor must have enough reduction gears to be strong.\n\nThe circuit\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nParts needed:\n\n  Bluetooth receiver (I used the BlueSMiRF Silver modem from Sparkfun, but you can also try the classic HC-06, that is cheaper)\n  An Arduino UNO or similar\n  H-bridge (I used a L6203)\n  Ultrasonic sensor\n  Servo motor (strong, with metal gears if possible)\n  Buzzer\n  LED for frontal light\n  9V battery pack\n  Double-sided matrix board\n\n\nNote that the servo motor I used needs 6V, so I added an LM317 to the circuit. Feel free to remove it if your servo requires 5V. Be patient, pick a solderer and make your own Arduino shield!\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nThe Arduino sketch\n\nThe small sketch receives the data, turns on and off the motor and checks the distance from a wall. RoverBluetooth receives data from the Bluetooth modem and associates numbers to commands. For example, “21” is interpreted as “turn off the motor”. Here’s the list:\n\n  0-20 → servo motor position\n  21 → motor off\n  22 → light on\n  23 → light off\n  1000-1255 → motor on, speed\n  1500-1755 → motor on, reverse gear, speed\n\n\nDownloads\n\ncloud_downloadAutodesk Eagle 9.3.0 schematic\n\ncloud_downloadMIT App Inventor project and APK\n\ncloud_downloadArduino sketch\n\ncloud_downloadAutodesk Eagle 9.3.0 schematic\n\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.\n\n",

Installers in the install-kit folder will guide you through updating the system, installing, configuring and starting the server and its dependencies, just run them in the correct order. If you don’t need OpenFocuser, script 4 can be skipped without problems. You’ll be asked for a hostname for the server, a password for the hotspot mode and the network interface to control via Bluetooth. INDI and bluez will be downloaded/updated automatically and common troubles about Bluetooth in Raspbian will be fixed. Then some systemd services will be set up to correctly start the Bluetooth controller and indiserver.\n\nAndroid app\nI’m still working on a good Android app for Telescope-Pi. In the meanwhile, you can use a Bluetooth serial terminal app (in this way, it should work even with iPhones or desktop Bluetooth terminals, but I’ve never tested it in these ways): just connect to the board and all the available commands will be listed. Chose an option by sending a number and start controlling your Raspberry!\n\n\n",

    "content": "Go back\n\nThe laser cut box\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nCut this structure from plywood (4 mm thick) with a laser cut machine, then asseble it, put the components on the panels and fix them with some nails and vinilic glue. Download DXF/DWG files at the bottom of this page (designed with AutoCAD 2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThe structure\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n  \n  \n\n\nIf you haven’t got a pendulum, you can make one yourself starting from this example (it’s an exact copy of the one I made). A 27,5·16·1 cm piece of plywood, a 5·27,5·2 cm splint and a rod are enough. Then use rings, fishing wire and a ball to complete the pendulum.\n\nThe mass\n\nI hadn’t got an iron mass (would be better, of course), so I made a ball with a 3D printer and I added a ring to hang it to the wire. The heavier and thinner it is (see pendulum clocks: the mass is flat to avoid friction with air), the longer it will oscillate.\n\nThe PCB\n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nThis is the less expensive method to create a homemade PCB using only low-cost stuff:\n\n  Laser printer (600 dpi or better)\n  Photo paper\n  Blank circuit board\n  Muriatic acid (&gt;10% HCl)\n  Hydrogen peroxide (10% solution)\n  Clothes iron\n  Acetone\n  Steel wool\n  Safety goggles and gloves\n  Sodium bicarbonate\n  Vinegar\n  Paper towel\n\n\nThe first step is cleaning the blank PCB with steel wool and water. If the copper appears a bit oxidized, you should wash it with vinegar before. Then, scrub the copper side with a paper towel soaked in acetone to remove any remaining dirt. Accurately rub every part of the board. Do not touch the copper with hands!\n\nPrint the PCB.pdf file at the bottom of this page using a laser printer and do not touch it with fingers. Cut it, align the image on the copper side and press it with the clothes iron (it must be hot but without vapour) for about five minutes. Let it cool with all the paper, then remove the paper very slowly and carefully under water. If there’s no toner on the copper, repeat the procedure; Use a small permanent marker to fix some missing connections.\n\nNow it’s time to use acid to etch the PCB. In a plastic box put three glasses of muriatic acid and one of hydrogen peroxide; you can also try with equal amounts for a more powerful etching. Put the PCB in the solution (pay attention to your hands and eyes) and wait about ten minutes. When the etching is finished remove the board from the solution and wash under water. Put two spoons of sodium bicarbonate in the acid to neutralize the solution and throw it in the WC (or take it to a waste collection centre).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n\nElectronics\n\nHere’s the schematic:\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n        \n            \n        \n    \n    \n\n\nParts needed:\n\n  ATMEGA328P MCU\n  2x 22 pF capacitors\n  3x 100 uF capacitors\n  2x 1N4148 diodes\n  7805TV voltage regulator\n  6x 10K resistors\n  2x 220R resistors\n  16 MHz crystal oscillator\n  Pinheads\n  USB-to-serial adapter\n  940nm side-looking infrared emitters and IR detectors (I bought these from Sparkfun)\n  9V battery and battery holder\n  16x2 LCD screen\n  2 buttons\n  A potentiometer and a trimmer\n  Wires, wires and wires\n\n\nNow that you’ve bought and collected the components, pick a solderer and solder them all! Then fix the PCB in the box, connect all the wires to the LCD, the USB-to-serial adapter, the potentiometer and the trimmer (for display brightness and contrast). Refer to the schematic, the PCB model in the previous step and to Eagle CAD files at the bottom of this page to correctly place all the parts and wires.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nSensors\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nAdd the sensors as shown in the pictures, then make some caps (I used a rotary tool to engrave them from a wood splint) to cover and protect them.

I added a homemade MoonLite-compatible focuser to the optical tube assembly and a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (a tiny ARM computer) to remotely control my telescope from the backyard to my house during the coldest nights. It’s not such an expensive gear because several items are homemade and what isn’t is exploited as much as I can and, with it, I achieved great results: the focal length of 1000mm allows me to photograph wide as well as small objects like galaxies or nebulae and, with auto guiding, I can take 6 minutes long photos. I live in a very light polluted area, so I use an UHC filter. For processing the photos I use Astro Pixel Processor and all the equipment is controlled via INDI and KStars running on the Raspberry Pi and on my Ubuntu computer.\n\nProjects for my telescope\nHope you’ll enjoy them all!\n\nTelescope-Pi\nTelescope-Pi is the name I gave to the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ I use to remotely control my telescope.

It contains a homemade Arduino UNO that uses an USB-to-serial adapter to communicate with your computer. JustAPendulum is highly accurate and has a companion (written in Visual Basic .NET) that, in real-time, will show you the position of the mass and a table and a graph with all the precedent measures. Completely laser cut and homemade, it’s very easy-to-use: just push a button and let the mass fall and the board will calculate everything. Ideal for tests in physics classes!\n\nMathsTests\nDon’t you think that maths is hard? You’re right, but I love it. That’s why I made this app: MathsTests can help you factorizing polynomials and particular trinomials using Ruffini’s rule! Fast, lightweight and open-source, it’s a great app for everyone who needs help with polynomials. I’m not in charge if you take a bad mark after using it during a test!\n\nRoverBluetooth\nThis was my first project and I made it for my school exams at the age of thirteen. Exhibited at  Maker Faire Rome! This car is based on an Arduino UNO, world’s #1 open-source board and is made only from low-cost components, easy to find everywhere: nothing has to be made with a professional machine! An old Meccano® pack is all you need for the body of this car, while an H-bridge,  a motor, a battery pack, and an ultrasonic distance sensor are required for the circuit.\n",
